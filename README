vkbd is a virtual keyboard that allow userland applications to send keyboard event to system in a very easy way.
When insmoding the vkbd.ko module, the /proc/kbd entry is created. You can just write your key event or read the last key event sent to vkbd.
vkbd uses a simple format: "%+04d"
A positive value means KEY_PRESS and a negative one means KEY_RELEASE.

ex: simulate a key press on "g" (KEY_G = 34 )
	$> echo +0034 > /proc/kbd

ex: simulate a key release on "g" (KEY_G = 34 )
	$> echo -0034 > /proc/kbd

The keycodes list can be retrieved from /usr/include/linux/input.h
